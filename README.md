# Basic Interpreter

### This is an interpreter written in python for a language with BASIC-like syntax. It probably has a bunch of bugs and I should probably write some tests, but the basic stuff like control flow, variables, functions and even recursion works fine.

# Demo

### I wrote an example program as a demo.

### If you want to try it out, from the prject root, run

### `python shell.py`

### from the project root. Then, from the interpreter terminal, run:

### `RUN("example.mybasic")`

### Props to CodePulse's Youtube channel for inspiring this project
